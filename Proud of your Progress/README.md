## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:** Use the provided [link](https://github.com/CodeSpace-Academy/Module_7_StudentNo_Classcode_Group_Name-Surname_JSL07) to clone the repository and start working in a local environment.
2. **Code:** Addressed each challenge following the project objectives and features.
3. **Commit Changes:** Regularly commit the work with descriptive messages.
4. **Push Updates:** Upload the commits to GitHub, ensuring your repository reflects the latest changes.
5. **Verify Submission:** Double-check the GitHub repository for the final code and push any last-minute updates. 

## Learning Outcomes

1. In this project the learning outcomes were for us to better understand the DOM, by using various methods to manupulate, create and add HTML elements using JavaScript.
2.Implementing the display of the certificate in a modal upon form submission, with the modal initially hidden, and enabling interaction handling for modal display and closure with a close button. Additionally, ensuring that form inputs are cleared post-submission.
3. Learnt how use inner.HTML, also the dangers associated with it. 
4. Checker for errors and attention to detail is also a  key part of this learning outcome.
5. Developing skills in debugging code.
6. In going the extra mile by creating a download button that allows the user to download the gererated certificate I learned how to convert an HTML into a PDF file by using htmtopdf method.
